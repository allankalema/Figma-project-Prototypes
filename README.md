# Warehouse Management System Project

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=526669888)

This project is a warehouse management system designed to improve the organization and accessibility of inventory, streamline order processing, and provide tailored dashboards for each user role. Through dedicated interfaces, owners, managers, and shop staff can effectively manage their tasks within the system.

## Project Overview

The warehouse management system is built to be user-friendly and role-specific, ensuring each user has access to features that suit their responsibilities. Key functionalities include:

- **Inventory Tracking**: Users can monitor stock levels, update product details, and track expiration dates.
- **Order Processing**: The system supports order creation, acceptance, and rejection, with real-time notifications to keep relevant staff updated.
- **User Roles**: Custom dashboards for owners, managers, and shop staff to streamline specific tasks, such as product updates, shop management, and order tracking.

## Prototypes and Design Process

### Figma Prototypes
The prototypes were developed using Figma, first in low-fidelity (lo-fi) and then in high-fidelity (hi-fi). These prototypes map out the user flows and page layouts, moving from basic structure (lo-fi) to a more polished and detailed look (hi-fi). The designs helped validate usability and functionality before moving to development.

> **Note**: Direct integration with GitHub from Figma requires the use of **Dev Mode**, which is available only in the paid version of Figma. Dev Mode enables smoother collaboration with developers by allowing direct export of code snippets, assets, and styling information to GitHub repositories.

## Using GitHub Codespaces

This project leverages GitHub Codespaces for a streamlined, cloud-based development environment. With GitHub Codespaces, you can start coding immediately with all dependencies pre-installed, eliminating the need for local setup.

### Codespaces Features

- **Pre-configured Environment**: Includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and all necessary libraries to get started right away.
- **Role-Specific Functionality**: Allows developers and educators to quickly access role-based templates and adjust the project for teaching or demonstration purposes.
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: AI-driven code assistance that can help you write code faster and with fewer errors.

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Open the Repository in Codespaces**: Click the Codespaces badge at the top of this README to open the repository directly in a new Codespace.
2. **Start Coding**: The development environment includes all dependencies, so you can begin working immediately without additional setup.
3. **Access Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebook is pre-installed, allowing for data analysis and testing within the project.

## Customization

This repository includes configuration files to adjust the development environment as needed. You can easily customize:

- **Python Environment**: Modify the Python version in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
- **Extensions**: Add or remove VSCode extensions to enhance functionality.
- **Dotfiles and Settings**: Configure specific settings to create a consistent environment across all users.
